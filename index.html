        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <img src="badminton.webp" alt="badminton">
        <p>
            <span>Badminton</span> is a racquet sport played using racquets to hit a shuttlecock across a net.
            Although it may be played with larger teams, the most common forms of the game are "singles"
            (with one player per side) and "doubles" (with two players per side).
            Badminton is often played as a casual outdoor activity in a yard or on a beach;
            formal games are played on a rectangular indoor court.
            Points are scored by striking the shuttlecock with the racquet and landing it within the
            other team's half of the court.
            <br>
            <br>
            Each side may only strike the shuttlecock once before it passes over the net.
            Play ends once the shuttlecock has struck the floor or ground,
            or if a fault has been called by the umpire, service judge, or (in their absence) the opposing side.
        </p>

        <h2>History</h2>
        <img src="history.webp" alt="history">
        <p>
            Games employing shuttlecocks have been played for centuries across Eurasia, but the modern game of
            badminton developed in the mid-19th century among the expatriate officers of British India as a variant of
            the earlier game of battledore and shuttlecock. ("Battledore" was an older term for "racquet".) Its exact
            origin remains obscure. The name derives from the Duke of Beaufort's Badminton House in Gloucestershire,
            but why or when remains unclear.
            <br>
            <br>
            The game originally developed in India among the British expatriates, where it was very popular by the
            1870s. Ball badminton, a form of the game played with a wool ball instead of a shuttlecock, was being
            played in Thanjavur as early as the 1850s and was at first played interchangeably with badminton by the
            British, the woollen ball being preferred in windy or wet weather.

        <h2>Rules</h2>
        <img src="" alt="">
        <p>Here are the essential rules and points that govern the game of badminton.</p>
        <h3>General Scoring Rules:</h3>
        <img src="service rules.png" alt="general rules image">
        <p>
            1) Match Format: A match is played best out of three games.
            <br><br>
            2) Points Per Game: Each game is played to 21 points.
            <br><br>
            3) Winning a Game: The first player or team to reach 21 points wins the game, provided they have a 2-point
            lead. If the score reaches 20-20, the game continues until a player or team gains a 2-point lead (e.g.,
            22-20, 23-21). The maximum score can be 30 points; if the score reaches 29-29, the next point wins the game.
            <br><br>
            4) Scoring System: A point is scored on every serve, regardless of which side is serving. This is known as
            the
            "rally point" scoring system.
            <br><br>
            5) Winning the Match: The first player or team to win two games wins the match.
        </p>

        <h3>Serving Rules:</h3>
        <img src="serving rules.webp" alt="serving rules">
        <p>
            1) Service Area: The server must serve from the correct service court. In singles, the server serves from
            the right
            service court when their score is even and from the left service court when their score is odd. In doubles,
            the
            serving team switches service courts each time they win a point.
            <br><br>
            2) Legal Serve: The shuttle must be hit below the server's waist and the racket head must be pointing
            downwards.
            The serve must travel diagonally to the opposite service court.
            <br><br>
            3) Service Faults: If the shuttle lands outside the correct service court, does not cross the net, or the
            server
            commits a foot fault, it is a fault and the opponent wins the point.
        </p>

        <h3>Court and Equipment:</h3>
        <img src="court rules.png" alt="court rules image">
        <p>
            1) Court Dimensions: The court is 13.4 meters long and 6.1 meters wide for doubles. For singles, the width
            is
            reduced to 5.18 meters.
            <br><br>
            2) Net Height: The net is 1.55 meters high at the edges and 1.524 meters high in the center.
            <br><br>
            3) Shuttlecock: Made of feathers or synthetic materials, the shuttlecock must weigh between 4.74 and 5.50
            grams.
            <br><br>
            4) Racket: There are no specific size or weight requirements for rackets, but they must conform to the
            general
            shape and construction standards set by the Badminton World Federation (BWF).

        <h2>Getting Started with Badminton: A Guide for New Players</h2>
        <img src="begin.jpeg" alt="beginner">
        <h3>Equipment Needed:</h3>
        <p>
            1) Racket:<br> Choose a lightweight racket (around 85-90 grams) with good balance and flexibility.
            <br><br>
            2) Shuttlecocks:<br> Opt for plastic shuttlecocks for durability during practice.
            Feather shuttlecocks offer better flight quality but are more fragile and expensive.

            <br><br>
            3) Footwear:<br> Badminton-specific shoes with good grip, cushioning, and lateral support to prevent
            injuries.
            Avoid running shoes as they don't provide the necessary support for quick lateral movements.
            <br><br>
            4) Apparel:<br> Wear comfortable, breathable sportswear that allows for full range of motion.
            Moisture-wicking fabrics are preferable to keep you dry.
            <br><br>
            5) Grip: <br>Overgrips or replacement grips can be used to enhance comfort and control.
            Choose a grip thickness that feels comfortable in your hand.
        </p>
        <h3>Basic Strategies:</h3>
        <p>
            1) Footwork:<br> Good footwork is crucial. Practice moving quickly and efficiently around the court.
            Learn the basic movements: side-step, chasse step, and lunge.
            <br><br>
            2) Grip:<br> Use the correct grip for forehand and backhand shots. A basic forehand grip is similar to
            shaking
            hands with the racket.
            For backhand shots, rotate the racket slightly in your hand for better control.
            <br><br>
            3) Serve:<br> Master the basic serves: low serve, high serve, and flick serve.
            Aim to serve accurately and vary your serves to keep your opponent guessing.

            <br><br>
            4) Basic Shots:<br>
            <br>i. Clear:<br> Hitting the shuttle to the back of the opponent's court to create space.
            <br><br>ii. Drop:<br> A gentle shot that falls just over the net, forcing your opponent to move forward.
            <br><br>iii. Smash:<br> A powerful downward shot aimed to finish the rally.
            <br><br>iv. Drive:<br> A flat, fast shot played across the net.

            <br><br>
            5) Positioning: <br>Maintain a central position (the base) when waiting for the opponent’s return to cover
            the
            court effectively.<br>
            Be ready to move in any direction quickly.
        </p>
        <h3>Beginner Tips:</h3>
        <p>
            <br>1) Practice Regularly:<br> Consistent practice helps improve skills and build muscle memory.
            <br><br>
            <br>2) Watch and Learn:<br> Watch professional matches to understand advanced strategies and techniques.
            <br><br>
            <br>3) Play with Others:<br> Playing with more experienced players can accelerate your learning.
            <br><br>
            <br>4) Stay Fit:<br> Badminton requires agility, speed, and endurance. Engage in regular fitness training,
            including cardiovascular workouts, strength training, and flexibility exercises.
            <br><br>
            <br>5) Learn the Rules:<br> Familiarize yourself with the basic rules and scoring system of badminton.
            <br><br>
            <br>6) Warm Up and Cool Down:<br> Always start with a warm-up to prepare your muscles and reduce the risk of
            injury.
            <br><br>
            <br>7) Be Patient:<br> Progress may be slow initially, but persistence and consistent effort will lead to
            improvement.
